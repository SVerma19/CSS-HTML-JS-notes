BASIC STRUCTURE OF HTML DOCUMENTS
<!DOCTYPE html> --> Tells broswer this is an html doc + what version of html is being used

<html> --> every html element has an open and closed element. tells broswer everything inside is html
	
	<head> 
		<!--scripts, styles, meta information-->
	</head>
	
	<body>
		<!--the content of the page-->
	</body>

</html>


SOME MAIN TAGS IN HTML
-Some tags have to be closed (with a /)
-Within the tags are many attributes that specify things about the content in the tag/what the content is doing

<p> --> general tag
<meta> --> tells broswer character encoding
<title> --> appears at the top of the browser
<div> --> everything in the the tag belongs together
<li> --> list
<header> --> represents a container for introductory content or a set of navigational links
<nav> --> defines a set of naviagtion links
<main> --> specifies the main content of a document
<article> --> specifies independent self-contained content
<aside> --> defines content other than the content it was placed in
<footer> --> footer tag
<audio> --> use this to have an audio control bar on the page + have the browser play audio
<canvas> --> provides place in page to paint on in order to dispaly custom page
<form> --> use this to post information from the broswer to server (text that a user enters in a text field)d
<input> --> what a user clicks on when they want to send infromation to the server
<video> --> can display a video in the broswer
<script> --> includes script of code for various functions


HTML WITH A FRAMEWORK
-can use to generate html, connect to a database,...
...look into more


STYLE HTML w/ CSS
-multiple methods

CSS Syntax Selectors + Advanced Syntax

CSS Priority
-can create large and complex hierarchies in CSS

CSS Preprocessors


BASIC JAVASCRIPT
document.write(a, b); --> to write/print something
let [or] var --> establishes variable
typeof(); --> prints what type of element the variable is

Some Array Methods (Mostly same as Java):
let values = [1, 2, 3]; --> creates an array
values [0] --> element in array
values.length --> length of array
values.push(a) --> pushes element into an array (stacks/queues)
values.pop(a) --> removes last element from an array (stacks/queues)
values.shift(a) --> removes first element from an array
values.splice(index of element, how many elements to delete, any elements you want to add) --> deletes values from array

Switch Statement
Ex. let state = "RI"
	
	switch(state) {
		case "NY":
			document.write("New York");
			break;
		case "RI":
			document.write("Rhode Island");
			break;
	}

Objects
Ex. let person = {
		name: "John", --> items in object called properties (of different types)
		age: 32,
		partTime: false,
};
console.log(person.name) --> access property within object

Array of Objects
Ex. let cards = [
		{
			suit: "Hearts",
			value: "Queen"
		},

		{
			suit: "Clubs",
			value: "King"
		}
];
console.log(cards[1].value) --> outputs value (.suit outputs suit)

Common Built-In Objects
	Math
	Date
	String
	Number


GENERAL NOTES
-Watch for reserved keywords in JavaScript
-Simple rules for strings, operators, loops, arrays, etc. are the SAME AS JAVA
-(+) symbol can also be used for concatination of strings
-Be aware of funky calculation outputs
-JavaScript initializes variables as undefined (not manually set)
-If trying to blank out a variable by oneself, set it to null (not undefined)
